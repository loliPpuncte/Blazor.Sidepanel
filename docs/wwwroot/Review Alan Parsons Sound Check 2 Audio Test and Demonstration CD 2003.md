The disc contains 99 tracks of practical material compiled as a result of careful research and investigation into the needs of studio engineers, audio technicians, serious audiophiles, record producers and musicians. It includes a range of test tones, pink noise, spectrum analysis, polarity checks, frequency sweeps, dynamic range tests, vocal tests, musical tests and surround sound tests. It also comes with a booklet that explains each track and how to use it effectively.
 
One of the highlights of this disc is the third octave tracks that form an instant system response analyzer when used in conjunction with the built-in microphone and sound level meter that comes with the double CD case version. You can easily measure the frequency response of your speakers and room acoustics by playing these tracks and reading the meter. Another highlight is the musical tests that feature some original compositions by Alan Parsons himself, as well as some excerpts from his albums. These tracks showcase different genres, instruments, vocals and effects that can be used to test the tonal balance, clarity, imaging and dynamics of your system.
 
*Sound Check 2* is a valuable tool for anyone who cares about sound quality and wants to optimize their audio equipment and environment. It is also a great way to enjoy some of the finest work of Alan Parsons, who is not only a master of sound engineering, but also a talented musician and composer. Whether you are a professional or a hobbyist, you will find this disc useful and entertaining.
  
One of the challenges of audio testing is to find a reliable reference point that can be used to compare different systems and settings. *Sound Check 2* provides such a reference point by using a 1kHz sine wave as the reference tone for all the test signals. This tone is recorded at -14dB FS (Full Scale), which is the theoretical maximum level obtainable on digital recordings. By setting your monitoring equipment and measuring equipment to this level, you can ensure that you are using a consistent and accurate standard for all your tests.
 
Another challenge of audio testing is to find a suitable source material that can reveal the strengths and weaknesses of your system and environment. *Sound Check 2* offers a variety of source material that covers different aspects of sound quality, such as frequency response, dynamic range, distortion, noise, phase, stereo imaging and surround sound. Some of the source material is purely technical, such as test tones, pink noise and frequency sweeps. Some of it is more musical, such as vocal tests, musical tests and surround sound tests. All of it is carefully selected and recorded by Alan Parsons, who has decades of experience and expertise in sound engineering and production.
 
*Sound Check 2* is not only a useful audio test disc, but also a fun and educational one. You can learn a lot about sound and how it works by listening to the tracks and reading the booklet. You can also experiment with different settings and configurations to see how they affect the sound quality. You can even use some of the tracks as background music or sound effects for your own projects. *Sound Check 2* is a disc that you will want to keep in your collection and use often.

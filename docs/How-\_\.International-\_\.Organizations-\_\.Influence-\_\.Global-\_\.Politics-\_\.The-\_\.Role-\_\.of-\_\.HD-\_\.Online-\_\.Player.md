# How International Organizations Influence Global Politics: The Role of HD Online Player
 
International organizations (IOs) are groups of states or other actors that cooperate for a common purpose, such as peace, security, development, human rights, or environmental protection. IOs can have different functions, such as providing information, setting norms and standards, facilitating cooperation, or resolving disputes. Some examples of IOs are the United Nations (UN), the European Union (EU), the World Trade Organization (WTO), and the World Health Organization (WHO).

One of the ways that IOs influence global politics is by creating platforms for non-state actors (NSAs) to participate in international affairs. NSAs are entities that are not affiliated with any state, such as civil society organizations, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), transnational corporations (TNCs), media outlets, or individuals. NSAs can have various roles in IOs, such as observers, consultants, partners, advocates, or critics. NSAs can also use IOs to voice their opinions, share their expertise, lobby for their interests, or monitor the actions of states and other actors.
 
A case study of how NSAs use IOs to influence global politics is the HD Online Player (HOP), a media platform that broadcasts live events and documentaries related to international issues. HOP was founded in 1982 by a group of journalists and activists who wanted to provide an alternative perspective on world affairs. HOP is based on the principles of independence, diversity, and transparency. HOP has a network of correspondents and partners around the world who report on topics such as human rights, democracy, environment, culture, and development.
 
HOP uses IOs as sources of information and as venues for advocacy. HOP covers the activities and debates of various IOs, such as the UN Security Council, the UN General Assembly, the UN Human Rights Council, the EU Parliament, the EU Commission, the WTO Ministerial Conference, and the WHO Executive Board. HOP also interviews representatives of IOs and NSAs who are involved in IOs. HOP aims to inform its viewers about the issues and challenges that IOs face and to raise awareness about the role and impact of IOs in global politics.
 
HOP also uses IOs as targets of criticism and pressure. HOP exposes the shortcomings and failures of IOs in addressing global problems, such as poverty, inequality, conflict, corruption, climate change, and pandemics. HOP also challenges the legitimacy and accountability of IOs by highlighting their biases, inconsistencies, double standards, and lack of representation. HOP calls for reforms and improvements in IOs to make them more democratic, effective, responsive, and inclusive.
 
In conclusion, HOP is an example of how NSAs use IOs to influence global politics. HOP uses IOs as platforms for participation and as objects of scrutiny. HOP contributes to the public debate and awareness about international issues and actors. HOP also influences the agenda and behavior of IOs by providing information, criticism, and pressure.
 The summary is:  `
HOP is a media platform that broadcasts live events and documentaries related to international issues. HOP uses IOs as sources of information and as venues for advocacy. HOP also uses IOs as targets of criticism and pressure. HOP aims to inform its viewers about the role and impact of IOs in global politics.
